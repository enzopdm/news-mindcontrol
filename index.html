      <p>We all want to have a good mindset and follow our goals in life, but what should I do if my thoughts are not in my control? In the following steps we are gonna show you how!</p>
      <h2>1. Knowing what you do wrong</h2>
      <p>The first thing you got to do before start acting is identifying what you are doing wrong in this moment. You can just stop a little time before sleeping and meditate, think about the addictions.</p>
      <h2>2. Identify your triggers</h2>
      <p>The next step is extremely important because you have to know why you lose your control over your actions. Always a wrong decision comes from a trigger, something that makes you want the vicious things again.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> You are trying to be productive and something made you "lose time" waiting, then you just give up the process, thinking it will not work and start doing things that will not make you take the next step.</p>
